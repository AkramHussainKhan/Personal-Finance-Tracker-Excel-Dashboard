# Personal-Finance-Tracker-Excel-Dashboard
 few days ago, I saw several people sharing beautiful dashboards, and it sparked something in me. I thought, why not give it a try?

While working on it, I had a personal realization.
𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴y can lead to a truly insightful and visually appealing dashboard. The wireframes played a big role in shaping the final look and feel.
Interestingly, designing the dashboard took more time than the 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀. The dataset was clean and straightforward, so the analysis was quick. But turning those insights into a well-structured and beautiful dashboard, that's where the real work was.

This experience reminded me that a dashboard isn't just about analysis. It’s about 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 in a way that speaks to people.
